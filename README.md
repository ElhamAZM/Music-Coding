# Music Genre Classification 

# Pytorch implementation

We use the GTZAN dataset which has been the most widely used in the music genre classification task. The dataset contains 30-second audio files including 10 different genres including reggae, classical, country, jazz, metal, pop, disco, hiphop, rock and blues. For this homework, we are going to use a subset of GTZAN with only 8 genres.
